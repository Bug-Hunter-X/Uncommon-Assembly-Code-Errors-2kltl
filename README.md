This repository contains examples of uncommon code errors and bugs that can occur in assembly language programming.  The examples highlight potential issues related to memory access, stack management, control flow, and register usage. Each example includes a description of the problem and a suggested solution.  These examples are intended to help developers understand and avoid these types of errors in their own assembly code.  The code is provided for educational purposes and should not be used in production environments without thorough review and testing.
